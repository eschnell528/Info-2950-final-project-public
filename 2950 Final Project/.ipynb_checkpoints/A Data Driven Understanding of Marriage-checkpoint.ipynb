    "Each row of the enclosed dataframe consists of the title of the book, the author’s gender, the estimated year of publication, and the number of occurrences of words that fit into the categories: anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, negative, positive, sadness, surprise, and trust.\n",

    "Question 1\n",
    "- I will determine how the categories (anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, negative, positive, sadness, surprise, and trust) are related to each other by identifying the principal components of the data using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), a common unsupervised dimensionality reduction algorithm. I may perform this analysis separately on the data gathered from books written by males and females.\n",
    "- Principal components are indices that are linear combinations of the original data categories. Understanding how the principal components are created for my data set will help me identify how variables are correlated within a higher dimensional data set. I hope to compare the results I obtain from my principal axes with results from a covariance matrix as a sanity check.\n",
    "- Dimensional reduction techniques allow the user to account for more variables at the cost of losing some of the variance enclosed within the data. I hope to leverage PCA, a quantitative dimensional reduction technique, to determine what portion of the variance can be attributed to various principal axes and identify an optimal tradeoff between retained variance and the power of my tests.\n",
    " \n",
    "Question 2\n",
    "- I plan to run regressions on each of the emotional scores versus time. Based on the results of the principal axes I identify using PCA, the regressions I run in this step will likely change. \n",

    " \n",
    "Question 3\n",
