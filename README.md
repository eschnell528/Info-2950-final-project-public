# Info-2950-final-project-public
I added this README file to make my data collection process easier to understand given that it contained many parts as I text mined my own data.
### Please see Phase 2 submission.ipynb for a description of how I clean the lexicon and collect the data about marriage. Descriptions of the process are included in this part
### In Get Predictors.ipynb I generate some of the predictors used in the final dataframe for marriage and produce the final dataframe that is imported at the start of the phase 5 final submission
### In data gen war, I re-run the data mining algorithm on war data to generate data for the first 20 books on war that appeared in project gutenberg. These were used for clustering against books on marriage to see if the two groups separate out
### The included txt files store the results of my data mining. The other files that are included are rough drafts of previous phases. These illustrate the iterative nature of my design process.
